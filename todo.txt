# Add middleware to handle connection timeouts
# Retrieve data from s3 using Go

# Containarize data collection
# Upload data collection to aws ElasticContainerService
# Use Eth prices as training labels (Adapt data cleansing, buy Conditions and Discord Notifications)

# Move the training to sagemaker?
# Make a revenue dashboard using streamlit? Serve through aws?
# Move the inference to kinesis? In that case check the record weights in kinesis
# Try Pytorch? Tensorflow's model.predict is too slow for the inference
