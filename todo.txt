# Respond to proxy api support with minimal reproducible example
# Containarize data collection

# Upload data collection to aws ElasticContainerService

# Move the training to sagemaker?
# Make a revenue dashboard using streamlit? Serve through aws?
# Move the inference to kinesis? In that case check the record weights in kinesis
# Try Pytorch? Tensorflow's model.predict is too slow for the inference
