# Containarize data collection

# Upload data collection to aws ElasticContainerService

# Move the training to sagemaker?
# Make a revenue dashboard using streamlit? Serve through aws?
# Move the inference to kinesis? In that case check the record weights in kinesis
# Try Pytorch? Tensorflow's model.predict is too slow for the inference
# Build database with auction prices?



# Project timeline (5 weeks):

# Exploring data collection and data
# Getting Mininum Viable Product
# Optimizing models
# DevOps - Automatizing, leveraging cloud and containers
