# Track revenue by scraping the blockchain explorer with a web scraping tool like Selenium/PlayWright or Colly for Go
# Get data tests to run on the cloud ? In that case connect great expectations to s3 buckets
# Move the training to sagemaker?
# Move the inference to kinesis? In that case check the record weights in kinesis
# Try Pytorch? Tensorflow's model.predict is too slow for the inference
# Build database with auction prices?
