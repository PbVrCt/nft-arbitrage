# Get acurrate price. Use a folder for experimenting with isolated functions. Reverse engineer axie tech

# Add concurrency adecuately, probs with more channels. Avoid cases of processing the same nft twice

# Check that using proxies works in inference.go. Call the function that retrieves older prices through proxies

# Do the data collection in go (cheaper to run on cloud)
# Get data collection into a container -> Upload to aws ElasticContainerService
# Collect data with Eth prices -> Use Eth prices as training labels -> Adapt buy Conditions and Discord Notifications

# Figure out if able to scan not recently listed nfts. Use postman to explore possible queries
# Investigate graph based machine learning
# Play around with the features and hyperparameters
# Train a NN

# Move the training to sagemaker?
# Make a revenue dashboard using streamlit? Serve through aws?
# Move the inference to kinesis? In that case check the record weights in kinesis
